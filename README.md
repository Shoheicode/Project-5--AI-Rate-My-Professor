## Description
AStar AI-Rate-My-Professor is a web application designed to helped assist students in the education industry to find professors that meet their needs. The project leverages frameworks such as React and OpenAI along with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver an experience that will help ease students into finding the professors that will help them excel in their educational journey. We also give them the ability to add their own professors that they enjoy.

## Features
1. Professor Search with AI Recommendations:
AI-powered search engine that uses OpenAI and RAG to recommend professors based on student needs and preferences.

2. Firebase Integration: AStar AI-Rate-My-Professor uses Firebase for secure, real-time backend services, storing user data, activity logs, and personalized saved professors. 

3. Professor Rating System: 
Ability to rate and review professors based on criteria such as teaching style, clarity, difficulty, and responsiveness.

4. Filtering and Sorting Professors
Filters to sort professors by ratings, departments, difficulty levels, and popularity among students.
